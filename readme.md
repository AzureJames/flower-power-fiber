I'm thinking of maybe making it a taiko game

Step 1:
see if I can get a text version of the genetic algo working at all
2: Tweak it and figure it out and see if it's good for a game potentially,
which would 0probably involve flowers getting to the optimal state (height/color?)
3: Mess with the actual game which will be either 
--taiko game with gen algo when you hit notes right
--taiko game with height increase every time
--Gen algo game with some other ideas or basic parameters (simulation)
4: -host on vercel
